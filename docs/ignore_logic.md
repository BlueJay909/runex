Below is a Markdown document that explains, step by step, how a call to `should_ignore` is processed. This guide uses an example and details the order in which functions are called to determine if a file or directory should be ignored according to the rules defined in our ignore logic.

# Execution Flow of `should_ignore`

This document explains how the `.gitignore` rules are processed by the Runex ignore logic code when `should_ignore` is called. We’ll walk through an example call to demonstrate the order of function invocations and internal logic.

## Example Scenario

Assume we have a project with the following simple `.gitignore` rule stored in a file (located at the root):

```
*.log
```

And we want to determine if the file `src/app.log` should be ignored.

## Step-by-Step Execution Flow

### 1. Instantiating the Scanner and Loading Patterns

- **Create a Scanner Instance:**  
  A `GitIgnoreScanner` is instantiated with the project’s root directory.

  ```python
  scanner = GitIgnoreScanner(root_dir="path/to/project")
  ```

- **Load Patterns:**  
  The scanner calls its `load_patterns()` method to traverse the directory tree and read all `.gitignore` files.  
  For each `.gitignore` file:
  - Each non-empty, non-comment line is extracted.
  - For each such line, a `GitIgnorePattern` instance is created:
    - In `GitIgnorePattern.__init__`, the pattern is processed:
      - **Negation Check:** If the pattern starts with `!`, it is marked as negated.
      - **Directory-only Check:** If the pattern ends with `/`, it’s flagged as directory-only.
      - **Case Folding:** Optionally converts the pattern to lowercase if case-insensitive matching is required.
    - The method then calls `compile_regex()` to compile a regex if the pattern includes a slash.

### 2. Calling `should_ignore`

- **Example Call:**  
  Now suppose we want to check if `src/app.log` should be ignored. We call:

  ```python
  ignore = scanner.should_ignore("src/app.log", is_dir=False)
  ```

### 3. Normalizing the Path

- **Path Normalization:**  
  Inside `should_ignore`, the provided path is normalized to use forward slashes.  
  For instance, `"src\app.log"` becomes `"src/app.log"`.

### 4. Iterating Over Collected Patterns

- **Looping Through Patterns:**  
  The scanner iterates over each `GitIgnorePattern` in its `self.patterns` list. For each pattern:
  - **Adjusting for Source Directory:**  
    If the pattern was defined in a subdirectory (i.e. its `source_dir` is non-empty), the path is adjusted by removing the directory prefix.  
    For example, if a pattern was defined in `src/`, the file path might be trimmed accordingly.
  - **Calling `hits()`:**  
    The scanner then calls the pattern’s `hits(match_path, is_dir)` method to check for a match.

### 5. Inside `GitIgnorePattern.hits()`

- **Directory-only Check:**  
  If the pattern is marked as directory-only but the current path is not a directory, `hits()` immediately returns `False`.

- **Determine Matching Method:**  
  - **Basename-Only Patterns (no `/` in pattern):**  
    - The function extracts the basename of the file (`app.log`).
    - It then calls `wildmatch()` with the raw pattern (`*.log`), the basename, and appropriate flags.  
    - If `wildmatch` returns `WM_MATCH`, the function returns `True`.
  - **Patterns Containing a Slash:**  
    - The path is normalized by adding a leading slash (e.g. `/src/app.log`).
    - The compiled regex from `compile_regex()` is used to attempt a full match against this normalized path.
    - The outcome (match or no match) is returned.

### 6. Handling Negation and Final Decision

- **Processing the Result:**  
  Back in `should_ignore`, if `hits()` returns a match, the result is adjusted for negation:
  - If the pattern was negated (i.e. started with `!`), the rule is inverted.
- **Aggregating Results:**  
  The scanner processes all matching patterns. If any pattern indicates the file should be ignored, `should_ignore` returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### 7. Returning the Outcome

- **Final Result:**  
  The `should_ignore` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the file (`src/app.log` in our example) should be ignored.

## Summary of the Function Call Order

1. **GitIgnoreScanner Initialization & Loading:**  
   - `GitIgnoreScanner(root_dir)`  
   - `GitIgnoreScanner.load_patterns()`  
     - Internally creates multiple `GitIgnorePattern` instances via `GitIgnorePattern.__init__()`
     - Calls `GitIgnorePattern.compile_regex()` for patterns with slashes

2. **Checking a Specific Path:**  
   - `GitIgnoreScanner.should_ignore("src/app.log", is_dir=False)`  
     - Normalizes the path  
     - Iterates over each pattern:
       - Adjusts the path based on `pattern.source_dir`
       - Calls `GitIgnorePattern.hits(match_path, is_dir)`
         - If no slash: calls `wildmatch()` on the basename  
         - If slash present: uses compiled regex for matching  
     - Applies negation rules as needed  
     - Returns the final decision

This structured flow ensures that each pattern is applied in the correct context, ultimately determining whether the file should be ignored. By following the above steps, the code effectively mimics Git’s own behavior for handling `.gitignore` files.
